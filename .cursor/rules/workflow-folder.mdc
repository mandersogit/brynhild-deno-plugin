# Workflow Folder Rule

## Rule: All AI-Generated Documentation Goes in `workflow/`

When creating documentation, plans, status reports, or tracking files, **always place them in the `workflow/` folder**.

### Files That MUST Go in `workflow/`

- Status reports and progress updates
- Development plans and roadmaps
- Architecture notes and design documents
- Task tracking and TODO lists
- Meeting notes or conversation summaries
- Analysis documents
- Any `.md` file that isn't a standard project file (like README.md)

### Correct Examples

```
✅ workflow/python-port-roadmap.md
✅ workflow/status-2024-01-15.md
✅ workflow/tool-analysis.md
✅ workflow/phase-1-notes.md
```

### Incorrect Examples

```
❌ PLAN.md (root level)
❌ STATUS.md (root level)
❌ notes.md (root level)
❌ TODO.md (root level)
```

### Exceptions (OK at root level)

- `README.md` - Standard project readme
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Release changelog
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines
- `LICENSE` / `LICENSE.md` - License file

### Why This Rule Exists

1. Keeps the project root clean and professional
2. All AI-generated working documents are in one place
3. Easy to find project context and history
4. Clear separation between project files and development artifacts

### Git Tracking

The `workflow/` folder is **gitignored from the main repo** but may be tracked as its own mini-repo for personal/internal use.

### Commit Plans Structure

```
workflow/
├── commit-plans/              # Plans for MAIN repo commits
│   └── 2026-01-10-feature.yaml
├── commit-plans-workflow/     # Plans for WORKFLOW repo commits
│   └── 2026-01-10-notes.yaml
├── *.md                       # Planning docs, status, notes
└── prototype/                 # Reference materials
```

### Committing to the Workflow Repo

When creating commit plans for the workflow mini-repo, use the `repo:` feature to target the workflow directory. This lets you run commit-helper from the project root:

```yaml
# workflow/commit-plans-workflow/2026-01-10-example.yaml
repo: workflow

commits:
  - message: |
      docs: add implementation notes
    files:
      - 2026-01-10-notes.md
```

Execute from project root:
```bash
./scripts/commit-helper.py workflow/commit-plans-workflow/2026-01-10-example.yaml --execute
```

**Do NOT** `cd workflow` and run commit-helper from there — always use `repo: workflow` and run from project root.

See `.cursor/rules/commit-plans.mdc` for full commit plan format.
